# 2-Player Hgher-Lower

This was a team project I participated in. The original repository got lost long ago.
It was part of an intership training.

The game was written in C#.
The first player gets a question and tries to answer it with a percentage.
The second player will make a guess if the actual answer is higher or lower than the answer of Player one.

The questions the players get are saved in a database with the answers.
Each player has a certain number of seconds to input an answer.
